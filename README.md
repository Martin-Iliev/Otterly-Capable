This is a game I made in a team with 4 artists during the 4th project of year 1 of the study. 
It's made in GXPEngine which is a C# game engine our teachers made. The game is physics based with a custom physics engine I wrote myself (the engine doesn't have vector physics by default). Game runs on GXPEngine which is included but it requires an older version of .NET to get it running. You can get it by installing visual studio 2019 and adding the .NET packages.
